## About

With a degree in Civil Engineering and a career pivot into software development, I bring an analytical and cross-disciplinary mindset to technology. My work bridges engineering rigor with business impact, allowing me to design solutions that are both technically sound and strategically aligned. Over the years, I’ve contributed to industries ranging from ERP and supply chain to financial services and agricultural insurance, always focused on transforming complex challenges into scalable, impactful systems.

My career began with the responsibility of establishing the technology department at a mid-sized company. I led the implementation of Odoo ERP, tailoring it to core operations. This initiative not only modernized the company’s processes but also automated critical workflows, significantly increasing productivity and operational efficiency.

Later, I joined Odoo SA’s Brussels office, collaborating on ERP projects across diverse sectors. Working remotely from Brazil, I adapted to a global team and delivered solutions that helped clients streamline operations and unlock measurable business value. This period broadened my perspective and deepened my ability to translate technical development into practical results for clients in varied industries.

Today, as Tech Lead at an agricultural insurance brokerage, I designed the platform’s architecture from the ground up, reducing insurance quotation times from hours to real time. The product’s success turned it into a SaaS adopted by multiple companies. I also lead a development team, ensure code quality, and oversee AWS-based infrastructure.

I position myself as a hands-on technical leader, advancing expertise in the technologies I master, while expanding into LLM engineering. My goal is to keep bridging technology and business, creating software that not only works at scale but also drives tangible impact for organizations and their customers.
